Here i'll be implementing some devsecops projects

## What is devsecops
Devsecops is basically devops with security mindset. 
Secure ci/cd is not devsecops.
Working with terraform for instance and using vault to secure sensitive information from the tf files, and using remote backend to take care of the tf file, that is considered as devsecops.
Also when working with ansible, and putting all sensitive information in a vault instead of a playbook. that is also considered devsecops.

## Why Devsecops
- growing adoption of AI assistants
- developers
